    <h3>What is Cryptography?</h3>
    <p id="subtopicText">Cryptography plays a major roll in cybersecurity.
        Its the practice of creating a system to protect of obsure information so only the systems with proper permission are allowed to view it.
        There are four core tenets of cryptology including:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Confidentiality: </b>Encrypted information can only be accessed by the person for whom it is intended and no one else.</li>
        <li><b>Integrity: </b>Encrypted information cannot be modified in storage or in transit between the sender and the intended receiver without any alterations being detected.</li>
        <li><b>Non-repudiation: </b>The creator or sender of encrypted information cannot deny their intention to send the information.</li>
        <li><b>Authentication: </b>The identities of the sender and receiver, as well as the origin and destination of the information are confirmed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p id="subtopicText">All of these ideas come together to create one of the most important aspects of cybersecurity.
        There are two main aspects of encryption that cryptographers use today.
        Those being symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography.
        Symmetric cryptography refers to when both the sender and the reciever of information use the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data.
        Asymmetric cryptography refers to using multiple keys which can be either private or shared.
