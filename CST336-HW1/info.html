    <h3>Why is cybersecurity so important?</h3>
    <p id="info">Cybersecurity is a very important field of Computer Science because it ensures the saftey of the devices we all use daily. 
        People who try to target and attack these devices are called cybercriminals. 
        These people focus on targeting devices with the intent of stealing information or damaging the device.
        There are many ways to ward off these attacks, with some of the important types including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>AI Security</li>
        <li>Critical infrastructure security</li>
        <li>Network security</li>
        <li>Endpoint security</li>
        <li>Application security</li>
        <li>Cloud security</li>
        <li>Information security</li>
        <li>Identity security</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="info">With there being so many types of security it makes it difficult for cybercriminals to attack their targets.
        Unfortunately, there are also many ways and tools that cybercriminals can use to access devices.
        When the cybercriminals attack these devices we call that a cyberattack, with the most common of them being:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Malware</li>
        <li>Ransomware</li>
        <li>Phishing attacks</li>
        <li>Credential theft and abuse</li>
        <li>Insider threats</li>
        <li>AI attacks</li>
        <li>Cryptojacking</li>
        <li>Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="info">Luckily, we live in a day and age where cybersecurity is working strong to stop cyberattacks. 
        But, with growing technology like AI many of the common cybersecurity tactics will need to be changed or upgraded to not allow these attacks.
        It is estimated by <abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr> that cybersecurity will cost the entire world economy USD 10.5 trillion a year.
